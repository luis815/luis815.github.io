        <p class="big">I’ve been working with computers since I was about 8 years old.  Although major part of my early carrier involved much imagination, I like to think I was doing something logical.</p>
        <p class="big">For instance, one of my favorite memories is about a broken disk which contained one of my uncle’s favorite games.  At the time, I was amazed by magnets and owned one of those toys that came with metal balls and plastic sticks with magnets at the end of them.  I created a structure that held the CD in place and applied “magnetism” to it.  I was happy about my creation, so of course I had to tell my uncle.  He congratulated me, but I’m sure he laughed at some point.</p>
        <p class="big">Eventually I became interested about what software and computers could do.  During this period of time, I was also introduced to PC gaming, nothing mind-blowing, but lots of fun.  If you played Avatar Legends of the Arena, we have to talk.  I also created a YouTube channel where I posted tutorials.  Simple things like how to record desktop and add a logo to a video.  I will not share this channel for embarrassing reasons, but I did get a few subscribers and lots of comments.</p>
        <p class="big">As PC gaming became something I enjoyed every day, I decided to build my own computer.  I went through every single tutorial on YouTube about how to build one and what parts to pick.  I decided on a budget gaming computer with the AMD FX 6300 and AMD Radeon 7770.  I’m so in love with that computer, even my college essay was about this.</p>
        <p class="big">I’m currently studying computer science at UB and my idea of what I want to create has changed over time.  I’m interested in creating mobile apps that simplify everyday tasks.  I hope my personality will influence my work.  I like simplicity, cleanliness, and hot chocolate (please donate some).</p>
