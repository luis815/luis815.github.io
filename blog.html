        <p class="big">Doing homework is becoming harder and harder by the second.  So much to do, not enough time.  People were not kidding about finals week.  Maybe I’m just complaining too much, but I would rather be doing other things right now.  In any case, I will get everything done eventually.  I just need to take one step at a time.  I did run out of cranberry juice during my intense homework session.  [Insert sad face here.]</p>
        <p class="big">As the semester comes to an end, I’ve been reflecting on a few things.  For instance, I still dislike English class.  Although I had a different experience this time, it still boiled down to the same problem, grading.  On the other hand, I’m very satisfied with what I’ve learned this semester.  Programming is fun and frustrating at the same time, which I like.  Java was a bit challenging at the beginning, but became easier after things start to repeat.  I’m really looking forward to what computer science has to offer.</p>
        <p class="big">Anyhow, I just realized I have even more work than I thought, so I should get to that.  Hopefully without procrastination this time.</p>
